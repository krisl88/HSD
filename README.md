# HSD

This was written on an older version of Xcode (14.x) on my personal laptop. 

The project code architecture is grouped into a few folders:
1) Vendor: SnapKit sources are droppined into the project in lieu of using a dependency manager
2) BoilerPlate VC and Appdelegate: Files that are auto-generated on starting a new project
3) Core: shared code
4) Router: Navigation
5) Services: NetworkService that leverages generics
6) Models: Object models from the API that is auto-generated by a tool to codables
7) DesignSystem: Bare bones design system
8) Views: Reusable views
9) ViewControllers: Both the Driver VC and alert VC

I tried to balance my time investment and creating a final product that showcases my skillset and I hope I landed somewhere in the middle. Most of the code are designed to be reusable and testable (both snapshot and unit tests, via dependency injections using protocols). I left comments ([KL]: xyz) wherever I feel the code could be improved with additional time.

In showing the trips list, I considered 2 UI approaches:
1) Make each trip a "section" in the tableview, each having a table section header and rows
2) Make one section, and each trip a row

I opted for #2 mainly for time considerations.
